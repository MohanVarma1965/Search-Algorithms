# Search-Algorithms

I have used JavaScript as the programming language.
Steps to run the program:
1.	Download the project
2.	Find the .html file with name home.html 
3.	Double click the home.html to open in it in the browser and user can enter the values to test the program.
4.	Once the home page is displayed in the browser the User Interface will be a shown below.

5.	Everything is clearly shown in the front page. We can change the input in the input matrix.
6.	User can click his choice of search algorithm and can modify the input and look for the solution path.
7.	Once the user clicks on the submit query the results are displayed.
